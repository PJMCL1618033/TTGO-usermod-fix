I was able to get this mod working by following the information from this post;
Usermods TTGO-T-Display does not compile  #4375
https://github.com/wled/WLED/issues/4375

The group of files I combined in the .7z provides aneasy way the consistently compile & upload. 
I really like the convenience of this usermod displaying the IP and other information. 

For me, using the normal install guide for this usermod always fails since WLED 0.13.
The TTGO-usermod-fix-main.zip file will setup VSC in a few step for consistsnt installation of this usermod.

1. Start with a known working module by installing the factory test program from the TTGO hardware test.7z. 
	Use NodeMCU-PyFlasher.exe to load it
